I'm a developer working at <a href="http://www.sol.no">Scandinavia Online</a>. During the day I work with exotic stuff like PHP, Python, Objective-C, Java and various other programming languages and systems that is required to develop and maintain one Norway's largest web sites.

During the night, I go wild and work with advanced computer algorithms and ... web games. While I actually care a lot about developing exciting business software, developing games is an exciting pastime that provides a nice challenge. Additionally, I get to use a bit of my creative side.
